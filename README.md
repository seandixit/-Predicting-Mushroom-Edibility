# Predicting Mushroom Edibility using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree
This project involves comparing Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models to predict whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous in R. It demonstrates thorough data preprocessing and cleaning to ensure dataset quality. It also does feature selection using Pearson Correlation, identifying the top 10 features correlated with the target variable. Using the rpart library, I developed a decision tree model using the rpart library with optimal pruning achieved through cross-validation, achieving 99.91% accuracy on the testing set. I also applied multiple logistic regression, transforming categorical values to numeric representations, and achieved an accuracy of 95% on the testing set. Visualization techniques, including heatmaps, bar plots, and ROC curves using Matplotlib, aided in understanding variable relationships and assessing model performance.
